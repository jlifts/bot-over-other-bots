# Bot Over Other Bots

A Typescript bot that is for testing and practicing functions and capabilities of a bot. If anything becomes interesting a more niche bot will be developed to solve issues or add abilities to discord servers.

## How to Start a Discord Bot

### Resources
[Discord Permission Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html)

[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs)


<ol>
<li>Either get Admin access on a Discord Server with friends or Create a Discord server for your bots</li>
<li>Go to the Developer Portal </li>
<li>Then go to the applications page and create your application</li>
<li>Under the tabs a Bot tab should be avalaible where you can enable the permissions and personalise the bot's appearance</li>
<li>Next, go to the Permission Calculator and after adding your Client ID, a link will generate that will allow you to add your bot to Servers</li>
<li>Now you can start coding your own bot! Just add your Keys and Ids to an env or leave it out of Git commits! After finishing the bot, you can host it on Heroku or Netlify to keep the bot online.</li>
</ol>

I hope this was helpful and Happy botting!
